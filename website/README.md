4.  What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of 
a.  In HTML almost all tags have an opening and a closing tag except probably a few like  <br/> however, in JSX any element can be written as a self-closing tag, for example: <div/>
b.  The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name, while you can’t use the word class to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className. 
c.  HTML elements have attributes e.g., maxlength in <input maxlength=”16″ />, but JSX elements have props e.g., maxLength in <input maxLength=”16″ />

5.  Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Browsers can't read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them.
